# Certifiably Correct Range-Aided SLAM (CORA)

This is the repo for our implementation of CORA. For now we provide a simple MATLAB implementation, primarily as a demo piece for extension and comparison. 
While it should be relatively easy to use, it is not tuned for performance.

Any feedback, issues, or contributions are welcome and encouraged! We'll do the best we can to provide support for hopeful users.

Python and C++ implementations are hopeful future contributions.

Enjoy!
