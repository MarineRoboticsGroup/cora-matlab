function A = multiscale(scale, A)
% Multiplies the 2D slices in a 3D matrix by individual scalars.
%
% function A = multiscale(scale, A)
%
% Given a vector scale of length N and a 3-D array A of size
% n-by-m-by-N, returns an array B of same size as A such that
% B(:, :, k) = scale(k) * A(:, :, k);

% Change log: 
%   Aug. 29, 2021 (NB):
%       Corrected bug that occurred for complex 'scale' vector.
%   Sep.  5, 2021 (NB):
%       Using .* rather than bxsfun as a preferred way: this is faster.
%       Kept the bsxfun code in a try/catch in case this causes trouble
%       with older versions of Matlab (unsure whether it would).
