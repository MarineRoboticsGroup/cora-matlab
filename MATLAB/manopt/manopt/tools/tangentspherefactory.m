function N = tangentspherefactory(M, x)
% Returns a manifold struct. for the sphere on the tangent space to M at x.
%
% N = tangentspherefactory(M, x)
%
% N defines a manifold that is the unit sphere on the tangent space to M
% at x. Points are represented as tangent vectors of unit norm. Tangent
% vectors are represented as tangent vectors orthogonal to the root point,
% with respect to the Riemannian metric on the tangent space.
%
% This is chiefly useful to solve optimization problems involving unit norm
% tangent vectors to M at x, which notably comes up when looking for
% extreme eigenvectors of the Hessian of a cost function on M at x, for
% example. The Riemannian structure on this sphere is that of a Riemannian
% submanifold of the (Euclidean) tangent space, equipped with the
% Riemannian metric of M at that point.

%   Nov 27, 2015 (NB):
%       Extra projection added in the retraction, to prevent numerical
%       drift.
%
%   Jun 23, 2021 (QR):
%       Extra projection in retraction changed to M.tangent.
%
%   Jun 23, 2021 (NB):
%       Several fixes to the logic of this factory that should help for
%       more sophisticated manifolds where representations of points,
%       tangent vectors and ambient vectors are not straightforward.
