% function [x, limitedbyTR, eigstrouble] = TRSgep(A, a, Del)
% function [x, limitedbyTR, eigstrouble, accurate] = TRSgep(A, a, Del)
% 
% This function returns a solution x to the following optimization problem:
% 
%     minimize .5*(x.'*A*x) + a.'*x
%     subject to x.'*x <= Del^2
% 
% The boolean 'limitedbyTR' is true if the solution would have been
% different absent the norm constraint. In that case, the norm of x is Del.
%
% The boolean 'eigstrouble' is false if the call to eigs went as planned
% (no NaN values returned). If is true otherwise. Even when true, the
% output x may still be good, but it is not certain.
%
% Inputs:
%   A: nxn symmetric
%   a: nx1 vector, both real
%   Del: trust-region radius (positive real)
%
% If called with three outputs, then computationally expensive checks are
% run to verify the accuracy of the output. If the output appears to be
% globally optimal (as expected) within some demanding numerical
% tolerances, then 'accurate' is true; otherwise it is false.
%
% The iterative solver pcg sometimes issues a warning.
% It can be disabled with:
%   warning('off', 'MATLAB:pcg:tooSmallTolerance');
% It is adviseable to re-enable it (with 'on' instead of 'off') when done.
